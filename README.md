# Hello-world
New repository

Hello,
I am not a developer at all and my English is enough bad. I've made my own professional website with the help of friends developers. I'm learning to use GitHub to manage my own account and website modifications. 
I continue to be helped by my friends to finalize my website. But your support and ideas are welcome !
It's very hard for me to understand developing and web developement, please be carefull and indulgent :)
See you later !
